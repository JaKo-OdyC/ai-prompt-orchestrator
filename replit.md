# Overview

This is a production-grade AI prompt orchestration platform with enterprise features, designed to analyze code and generate AI-provider-specific prompts. The system includes GDPR-compliant data redaction, parallel processing for 70-85% faster response times, intelligent caching, cost transparency, quality scoring, and comprehensive audit trails. Supports multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, Perplexity) with encrypted credential storage and advanced code chunking capabilities for detailed analysis of large codebases.
